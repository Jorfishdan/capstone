# Teacher's Pet

Teacher's Pet supports elementary educators in schools, camps, clubs and daycares to provide fun and user- friendly games to boost class management through fun and routine. It hosts three built in games: a true or false game, a clean up game and a listening game, that will motivate students to engage, collaborate and problem solve. Along the way, you'll have the app's virtual pet, named Mojo, cheering you on.

Head Scratchers is a true or false game for students to vote on the answer. Encourage them to explain why they chose their answer before revealing the correct answer. This game is flexible for how to vote, it can have students raise their hands to vote or have them move around the room to vote.

To add to the roster of question on Head Scratchers, click the 'Add a fact here' button on the top right of the screen.

The nav bar on each game page has an icon linked to another game page. Click on the dog food bowl for the Lightning Clean game. To play, simply pick a song, input the amount of minutes you want the students to clean up for.

Once the clock is up, click the 'Scan' button and tell the students that Mojo will be scanning the room for how clean it is and award points to the students for their hard work. As the educator, you can type out what Mojo will say and it will be hidden like a password until you choose to reveal the points and feedback to the class by clicking the checkbox to the right of the input bar.

And lastly, is the ever popular Sneaky Animals game. This game is great for younger students (K- Gr.3) to practice their listening skills, identifying animals and working together. Simply play the audio on the card that plays an animal noise and have the students guess which animal it is. Reveal the animal by clicking the card. To make it more challenging, decrease the volume either on your device or on the card itself to have the kids quieten and listen closer. For each correct answer, add a point - which is a bone for Mojo!
