# Teacher's Pet

Teacher's Pet supports elementary educators in schools, camps, clubs and daycares to provide fun and user- friendly games to boost class management through fun and routine. It hosts three built in games: a true or false game, a clean up game and a listening game, that will motivate students to engage, collaborate and problem solve. Along the way, you'll have the app's virtual pet, named Mojo, cheering you on.


## Getting Started

Git clone this app into your local repo: `` git@github.com:Jorfishdan/capstone``

In your project directory, you can run:

### `npm i` and `npm start`
To install and run the application.  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

NOTE: this app requires the corresponding backend server that's also hosted on my GitHub, [Server-Side]("https://github.com/Jorfishdan/capstone-teachers-pet-backend") 


# Built With

This application was built with React, Sass, Node.js and Express. Major shout out to Flaticon.com for the animations! 

# How to play
The homepage displays the key buttons to the three games (Head Scratchers, Lightning Clean and Sneaky Animals) as well as an info button on the top right for educators to review.

The info icon goes to the info page that has a brief overview of each game for educators to explore. Each button is linked to their respective game.

Head Scratchers is a true or false game for students to vote on the answer. Encourage them to explain why they chose their answer before revealing the correct answer. This game is flexible for how to vote, it can have students raise their hands to vote or have them move around the room to vote. It's a great game to foster collaboratio and critical thinking.

To add to the roster of question on Head Scratchers, click the 'Add a fact here' button on the top right of the screen. It's a great feature for educators to add facts that corresponds to their currciculum. Recommended for grades 3+.

The nav bar on each game page has an icon linked to another game page. Click on the dog food bowl for the Lightning Clean game. To play, simply pick a song, input the amount of minutes you want the students to clean up for. This game is ideal for all ages.

Once the clock is up, click the 'Scan' button and tell the students that Mojo will be scanning the room for how clean it is and award points to the students for their hard work. As the educator, you can type out what Mojo will say and it will be hidden like a password until you choose to reveal the points and feedback to the class by clicking the checkbox to the right of the input bar.

And lastly, is the ever popular Sneaky Animals game. This game is great for younger students (K- Gr.3) to practice their listening skills, identifying animals and working together. Simply play the audio on the card that plays an animal noise and have the students guess which animal it is. Reveal the animal by clicking the card. To make the game more challenging, decrease the volume either on your device or on the card itself to have the kids quieten and listen closer. For each correct answer, add a point - which is a bone for Mojo!

I learned a lot about getting creative when building an app with kids who will be playing the games in mind. For instance, thinking about how to keep the UI simple yet engaging as to not overwhelm them and to ensure the games are genuinely interesting for kids to play. 

I also stepped out of comfort zone and played around with creating a server for this app so that the true or false game was dynamic and so Mojo the virtual pet has a range of encouraging sayings. 

This is truly a passion project as I enjoy creating tools to support educators in their daily teachings and I look forward to continue to build out the server so that Mojo can keep track of points and so that the class can pick a class pet from a selection of avatars.

Thanks for checking out my app!
